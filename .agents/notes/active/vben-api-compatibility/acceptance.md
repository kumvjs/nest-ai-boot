# Planning Acceptance

- [x] Stable Vben baseline is identified by tag and immutable commit SHA.
- [x] `@vben/backend-mock` publication/installation suitability is evaluated.
- [x] Backend mock handlers and frontend-declared APIs are compared at the same commit.
- [x] Minimal runtime, system-management, preference, and playground APIs are separated.
- [x] Existing same-path backend endpoints are identified without claiming behavioral compatibility.
- [x] Persistence, business-rule, security, cache, migration, and contract-test work is represented in the backlog.
- [x] Swagger remains the API reference; no duplicate public endpoint document is introduced.
- [x] No endpoint/entity/service/migration implementation is performed in this phase.

Later implementation acceptance is defined per milestone in `plan.md` and must be refined before each milestone starts.

## Completed batch: M0.1

- [x] Upstream repository, tag, full SHA, source paths, expected counts, and snapshot path are machine-readable.
- [x] Collection uses a temporary shallow/filtered/sparse clone and verifies the checked-out SHA.
- [x] The snapshot deterministically records 31 frontend endpoints, 22 mock-covered endpoints, 9 frontend-only endpoints, and 2 mock-only diagnostics.
- [x] Hidden Nitro handler files such as `api/system/dept/.post.ts` are collected.
- [x] A clean network-backed collection reproduces the committed snapshot.
- [x] No application endpoint, authentication, authorization, entity, or migration code changed.

## Completed batch: M0.2

- [x] Candidate refs can be compared with the locked snapshot for route, method, request, response, mock-coverage, and source-only changes.
- [x] Same-ref comparison against `v5.7.0` reports no changes.
- [x] A scheduled/manual main warning reports drift without changing the stable lock or committed snapshot.
- [x] The upstream-upgrade PR template requires compatibility, migration, rollout, support-window, verification, and rollback decisions.
- [x] Frozen fixtures cover success/error envelopes, `{ items,total }` pagination, 401/403, refresh-cookie behavior, dynamic routes, and bigint serialization.
- [x] Contract parser/diff tests cover typed and multiline calls, hidden Nitro routes, and every required diff classification.
- [x] No application endpoint, authentication, authorization, entity, migration, or Swagger code changed.

## Completed batch: M1.1

- [x] `/auth/login` contract tests preserve `ResOp<{ accessToken }>` and the HttpOnly refresh cookie.
- [x] `/auth/refresh` contract tests preserve `ResOp<{ accessToken }>` while replacing the refresh cookie; missing cookies return HTTP 401.
- [x] `/auth/logout` contract tests prove delegation to the established access-token invalidation path without rewriting it.
- [x] `/user/info` maps bigint `id` to string `userId` through a dedicated Swagger DTO and does not expose entity/audit/password fields.
- [x] The frozen refresh fixture reflects the project OpenAPI client's `ResOp` unwrapping contract rather than the upstream mock's raw-token exception.
- [x] Focused Jest tests, test type-checking, lint, Nest build, and locked Vben fixture validation pass.

## Completed batch: M1.2

- [x] Refresh verifies the JWT, Redis state, database ownership, and expiration before rotation.
- [x] PostgreSQL atomic deletion is the single-use consumption point; a concurrent/replayed old token cannot issue a second token pair.
- [x] Successful rotation removes the old Redis refresh state, persists/caches a new Refresh Token, and issues a new Access Token.
- [x] Logout blacklists/removes the current Access Token, deletes the presented Refresh Token from PostgreSQL/Redis, and clears the browser cookie.
- [x] Malformed logout cookies are deleted by opaque value without trusting an invalid JWT payload.
- [x] The Vben integration guide includes the Swagger → OpenAPI-TS → `apiClient` generation, unwrapping, login, user-info, and refresh path.
- [x] Four focused Jest suites (11 tests), test type-checking, lint, Nest build, contract fixtures, and Markdown diff checks pass; the VitePress build is unverified because documentation dependencies are not installed locally.

## Completed batch: M1.3

- [x] `sys_user` persists nullable avatar URL, home path, and description through a reversible TypeORM migration.
- [x] `/user/info` returns explicit `userId`, `username`, `realName`, `avatar`, `homePath`, `desc`, and `roles` fields inside `ResOp`.
- [x] Existing NULL profile values normalize to empty strings without inventing a URL or route.
- [x] Access tokens, password fields, entity relations, and audit columns are excluded from the response DTO.
- [x] The compiled migration discovery path matches Nest's actual `dist/src/migrations` output.
- [x] Focused DTO/migration tests, test type-checking, lint, and Nest build pass; applying the migration to a live PostgreSQL database remains an environment deployment step.

## Completed batch: M1.4

- [x] `/auth/codes` returns effective menu/button permission codes rather than role codes, still wrapped by `ResOp<string[]>`.
- [x] Normal users receive codes only from enabled assigned roles and enabled menu/button records; comma-separated values are trimmed, empty values removed, duplicates removed, and results sorted deterministically.
- [x] A user with the enabled `super` role receives every enabled menu/button permission code without requiring explicit role-menu mappings.
- [x] Version-matching Redis permission-cache hits, including an empty `codes` array, do not query PostgreSQL; misses and legacy unversioned values load and repopulate the cache.
- [x] `RbacGuard` and `/auth/codes` use the same cache-backed effective-permission resolver.
- [x] A targeted permission-cache invalidation API exists for later menu/role/user transaction hooks, and its behavior is tested.
- [x] Swagger, current RBAC/Vben docs, focused tests, type-checking, lint, Nest build, contract parser tests, and locked Vben fixtures are updated and verified.

## Completed batch: M1.5

- [x] Local/development CORS defaults allow the locked Vben playground and Ant Design Vue app origins without using a credentialed wildcard; production requires an explicit HTTPS origin list.
- [x] Production requires an HTTPS public API URL and a Secure Refresh Token Cookie; `SameSite=None` is rejected unless Secure is enabled.
- [x] Refresh Cookie options are centralized, host-only by default, scoped to the API auth path, configurable for SameSite/Domain, and applied identically on login, refresh, and logout clearing.
- [x] Unsafe browser requests with an untrusted `Origin` receive HTTP 403 before authentication/business logic; trusted origins, preflight/safe methods, and non-browser requests without Origin remain supported.
- [x] The Fastify adapter no longer fabricates an Origin header when clients omit it.
- [x] Environment validation, controller Cookie contracts, trusted-origin behavior, docs, type-checking, lint, Nest build, contract parser tests, and locked Vben fixtures pass.

## Completed batch: M1.6

- [x] Unknown users and wrong passwords keep the same generic credential error; a disabled account is disclosed only after its submitted password verifies.
- [x] A disabled user cannot generate Access/Refresh Tokens, seed login caches, or create a login-success log.
- [x] Successful internal validation does not return `password_hash` or legacy `psalt`.
- [x] No password hashes are bulk-converted and no new account/reset flow copies the MD5 implementation.
- [x] M5 contains an actionable Argon2id-first mixed-hash migration, opportunistic rehash, inactive-account reset, session invalidation, rollout, and rollback checklist based on current OWASP guidance.
- [x] Request-lifecycle/auth documentation, focused and full tests, type-checking, lint, Nest build, contract parser tests, and locked Vben fixtures pass.

## Completed batch: M2.1–M2.2

- [x] Shared menu types represent `catalog`, `menu`, `embedded`, `link`, and `button`, with Vben-native numeric `0 | 1` status and extensible JSONB metadata.
- [x] Swagger write/list/dynamic-route DTOs express bigint IDs as strings, `pid`, recursive children, conditional route fields, and the complete known Vben metadata surface without requiring a domain adapter.
- [x] `SysMenuEntity` directly persists Vben semantics using `pid`, `name`, `path`, `auth_code`, `type`, `component`, `redirect`, `meta`, and `status`, plus self/role relations; legacy presentation columns are removed.
- [x] The fresh table model enforces five allowed types, numeric status, restrictive parent deletion, and unique name/path/authCode constraints; no legacy migration is created by design.
- [x] Effective permission queries retain their existing role/super-role behavior, read one canonical `authCode` per row, filter numeric enabled status, and deduplicate role-join results.
- [x] No menu endpoint or write business logic is exposed in this batch.
- [x] DTO/entity/permission tests, type-checking, lint, Nest build, contract parser tests, locked Vben fixtures, docs, and diff checks pass.

## Completed batch: M2.3

- [x] `GET /menu/all` is authenticated, documented by Swagger, and remains wrapped by the global `ResOp<VbenRouteRecordDto[]>` contract.
- [x] Enabled super users receive all enabled non-button routes; ordinary users receive routes granted through enabled roles and role-menu mappings.
- [x] A granted descendant or button includes its complete enabled route-parent chain, while disabled/orphaned/cyclic/pathless branches and button nodes are not emitted.
- [x] Route trees preserve Vben metadata and optional component/redirect fields, serialize bigint identity only internally, and sort recursively by `meta.order`, then unique name.
- [x] `sys_role_menu` uses bigint foreign keys, unique role/menu pairs, indexes, and deletion policies compatible with the rebuilt tables.
- [x] No system-menu list, existence check, CRUD, or cache invalidation write hook is implemented in this batch.
- [x] Service/controller/schema tests, full regression tests, type-checking, lint, Nest build, contract fixtures, docs, and diff checks pass.

## Completed batch: M2.4

- [x] `GET /system/menu/list` is authenticated, requires the canonical menu-list permission, and has a Swagger `ResOp<VbenMenuResponseDto[]>` contract.
- [x] The response contains every non-deleted catalog/menu/embedded/link/button record, including disabled records, without exposing entity audit fields or relations.
- [x] Bigint `id`/`pid`, numeric status, extensible metadata, optional route fields, and the v5.7.0 form-compatible top-level `activePath` retain Vben-compatible shapes without adding a redundant database column.
- [x] Every record appears exactly once in a recursively ordered tree; malformed missing/self/cyclic parent links are normalized safely without producing circular JSON.
- [x] No existence check, create/update/delete logic, or cache invalidation hook is implemented in this batch.
- [x] Focused and full tests, type-checking, lint, Nest build, locked Vben contract fixtures, docs, and diff checks pass.

## Completed batch: M2.5

- [x] Remove the redundant direct `MenuModule` import from `AppModule` without changing `/menu/all` or `/system/menu/*` controller paths.
- [x] `GET /system/menu/name-exists` and `GET /system/menu/path-exists` are authenticated, require `system:menu:list`, and expose Swagger `ResOp<boolean>` contracts.
- [x] Both endpoints validate their required query value and an optional positive bigint-string edit ID.
- [x] Existence queries use the same exact, case-sensitive value semantics as the active-row unique indexes and exclude only the supplied edit ID.
- [x] Soft-deleted rows remain excluded through TypeORM's default repository scope, and partial unique indexes allow their values to be reused without a later write conflict.
- [x] No menu create/update/delete logic or cache invalidation hook is implemented in this batch.
- [x] Focused and full tests, type-checking, lint, Nest build, locked Vben contract fixtures, docs, and diff checks pass.

## Completed batch: M2.6

- [x] `POST /system/menu`, `PUT /system/menu/:id`, and `DELETE /system/menu/:id` use dedicated create/update/delete permissions and preserve the global `ResOp<boolean>` response contract.
- [x] Create and update enforce the locked Vben form's five type-dependent contracts: route paths, menu components, embedded/link HTTP(S) targets, button permission codes, titles, and compatible `activePath`/`linkSrc` metadata mapping.
- [x] Names, paths, permission codes, component identifiers, metadata values, PostgreSQL bigint IDs, and concurrent unique-constraint failures are validated without trusting the frontend prechecks.
- [x] Parent records must exist and be parent-capable; self-parenting, existing corrupt ancestor chains, descendant reparenting, and converting a node with children into a leaf type are rejected in a serializable write transaction.
- [x] Delete is a soft delete and is rejected while active children or active role-menu references exist.
- [x] After commit, menu writes invalidate permission caches for distinct users assigned through the affected menu's enabled roles plus users assigned the enabled super role; create invalidates super users without scanning Redis.
- [x] Focused/full tests, test type-checking, changed-file ESLint, Nest build, locked Vben fixtures/diff, docs, and diff checks pass. Repository-wide ESLint still reports pre-existing errors outside this batch, and VitePress dependencies are not installed.
